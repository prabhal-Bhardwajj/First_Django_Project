UPDATED LOG_IN , SIGN_UP FEATURES , CALENDAR FEATURES , QUALITY FRONT END CHANGES AND REFINED VIEW OF EVERYTHING 
MORE REFINED UP WITH BETTER TEXT EDITOR SERVED IN ADD_JOURNAL , EDIT_JOURNAL , WITH BETTER PAGINATION , TAGS AND ADDING MOOD FILTER.
FOR NOW I DECIDE TO REMOVE THE LONG TERM GOAL FOR NOW BECAUSE I WANTED TO CREATE A NEW HABIT TRACKER IN THE TODOAPP , WITH BETTER CALENDAR FEATURES

and added tests filter so that if in future app wants to go in full test mode it shall go upon with little hassle.
